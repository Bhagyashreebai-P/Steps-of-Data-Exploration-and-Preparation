Remember the quality of your inputs decide the quality of your output. So, once you have got your business hypothesis ready, it makes sense to spend lot of time and efforts here. With my personal estimate, data exploration, cleaning and preparation can take up to 70% of your total project time.

Below are the steps involved to understand, clean and prepare your data for building your predictive model:

Variable Identification
Univariate Analysis
Bi-variate Analysis
Missing values treatment
Outlier treatment
Variable transformation
Variable creation
